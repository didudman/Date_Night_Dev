    <string name="date1">On one of our first dates, my guy and I challenged each other to a triathlon of activities we both liked, says Robyn H., 28, of Durham, NC. We decided to compete in foosball, Pac-man, and pizza-eating. We were laughing the whole time, and now, part of the fun of triathloning is coming up with three events we can compete in. We\'ve done ice skating, Connect Four, and MnM-eating, and another time we did swimming, diving, and onion ring eating.</string>
